# Red Movie Client
***
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and display movie lists.
This is for all movie lovers and people who are interested in seeking out new films to watch.
This repo contains the client side of the application, but you can access the server side [here](https://github.com/BraydenBridgeman/RedBadgeServer).

## CURRENT BUILD NOTES

- Users can delete and update their own comments and reviews.
- Users are able to retrieve data from the API to find a movie they want to add to their list.

## ISSUES
***
- Currently this app is in a very beta state. 
- Currently, you can only create one list, and save one movie at a time.
- Comments and Reviews work, but can only be posted one at a time.
- Will look into future builds with using a better API, and also allowing users to create more than one list and/or comment/review.
